# Sales-team-KPI-Automation-
In the sales team automation project, I used a dropdown to link all the monthly sheets. When a month is selected, the corresponding month's KPI sheet automatically opens. This makes it easier for employees to fill in their KPIs. Additionally, Iâ€™ve created a month-wise dashboard to track performance.
